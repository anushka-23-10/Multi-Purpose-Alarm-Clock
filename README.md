# Multi-Purpose-Alarm-Clock
This Clock combines all of the functionality you need into one simple package. Sets alarm; while taking notes and keeping track of all your notes from every new alarm setting, add timers, and run a stopwatch all at a single place. The notes managing system adds all the notes taken to a .csv file for future reference of your records.
